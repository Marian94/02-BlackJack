# BlackJack

Build a simple Blackjack game using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery.

It’s a page that opens in the browser, and lets the user play. You can find Blackjack’s rules here, it’s a relatively simple game.

Requirements

The user should be able to play against the computer.

Your implementation needs to give a "hit" and "stand" option to the user (no betting is required).

The user should easily understand what is happening in terms of who is winning or losing and whose turn it is.

The user should be able to play multiple games.

Feel free to choose and implement the UI you prefer.

Logic for the ace card must be considered and implemented.

Your CSS needs to be clean.

Use 3 separate files: one for CSS, one for HTML, and one for JavaScript and jQuery.

If your submission contains multiple lines of code taken from any online sources (like code snippets, articles, tutorials, etc.) add a comment citing that work. Copying code without attribution will disqualify you.
